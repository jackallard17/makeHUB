makeHUB is a prepackaged set of open source tools for maker spaces. makeHUB streamlines the process of setting up software needed for programming arduino boards and 3D printing!

The software provides a simple web interface to launch open source makerspace software. Currently makeHUB comes with the following:
  *ScratchX arduino programming GUI
  *Octoprint 3D printing software

My goal is for this software to lower the skill barrier for teachers and other makerspace organizers to deploy neat technologies in their maker spaces!
