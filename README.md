makeHUB is a prepackaged set of open source tools for maker spaces. makeHUB streamlines the process of setting up software needed for programming arduino boards and 3D printing!

makeHUB is a prepackaged raspbian installation which includes multiple open source software tools which are useful in maker spaces.

My goal is for this software to lower the skill barrier of teachers deploying neat technologies in their maker spaces!
